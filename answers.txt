"address"	2042

b. Running via EMR
"address"	215625



5. Does the local version and EMR version give the same answer?
No. The EMR version gives a larger number for time and for address tags because the two parts processed different amounts of data. The EMR version processed more files and therefore took longer and had more address tags.
